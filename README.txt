CSE20212 Final Project

====== What is this project? ======
This is our Final Project for CSE20212 (Fundamentals of Computing II) at Notre Dame. We worked on the project throughout the entire semester. The goal of the project was to develop a 3D First-Person game with the feel of the Original Side-scrolling Mario Bros. The most current version of this project can be found on Jeremy's github - https://github.com/Spartan97/Mario-3D

====== Installing and Running ======
To run this project, you first need two external libraries. We used Open GL Math (glm) to do vector and matrix calculations. This library can be found here: http://glm.g-truc.net/ 

Additionally, we used FMOD for music and sound effects. If you would rather skip this step and not have sound, you can comment out the line "#define PLAY_SOUNDS" near the top of main.cpp. If you do choose to use the library, it can be found here: http://www.fmod.org/

To compile the game, run the makefile found in the top level folder. If it compiles successfully, run the "main" executable generated by the makefile. The main design of this program was done on Mac OSX 10.6. It also runs as-is under some linux builds.

====== Controls ======
One you are in the game, the goal is to reach the flag at the end of the level without dying to enemies. Collecting power-ups from ? blocks and coins can help! These are the controls:
- WASD - movement
- Space - jump
- C - go down warp pipe
- Mouse Pointer - Look Around
- Mouse Click - Shoot Fireball (With Power)

====== Known "Bugs" ======
- Game takes 15-30 seconds to load a game. BE PATIENT.
	- Fix by using less objects, or by being patient.
	- Specifically, the Goombas and Koopas take a long time because they have the most detail
- Sometimes freezes computer when trying to quit.
	- Not actually sure what causes this. I think it's an error with GLUT trying to destroy the window when we are drawing to it.
- Enemies will walk right through power-ups and shells (but not each other or pipes)
	- Just need to add more for loops in simpleAI which calls collidesWith methods.
- Objects (fireballs, starmen, mushroom, shells, flowers) will go through each other
	- Same as above.
- Fireballs and stars sometimes fall through floor
	- Need to do separate for loops for x, y, and z collision so that y collision takes priority.
